What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?**\n","\n","-> A hash table is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs, using a hash function to quickly find the index for storing or retrieving values.

How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?**\n","\n","-> sets automatically eliminate duplicate values, ensuring that each element in a set is unique. When you create a set or add elements to it, any repeated values are ignored, so only one instance of each distinct element is stored. This behavior makes sets particularly useful when you need to filter out duplicates from a collection of items. For example, if you have a list with repeated numbers and convert it into a set, the duplicates will be removed. Consider the following:\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]\n","    unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n","    print(unique_numbers)\n","\n","\n","This will output:\n","\n","    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n","\n","\n","As shown, the set unique_numbers contains only one occurrence of each number, no matter how many times it appeared in the original list.
